## About Me

<p align="justify"> 
I am a PhD student in economics at Aalto University. I started my PhD studies in 2021, spent academic year 2023&ndash;24 at MIT Department of Economics, and plan to complete the PhD program in 2026. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
My research is mostly theoretical. However, it addresses questions that are close to real-world issues of the 21st century. I am particularly interested in how incomplete information influences market behavior and optimal government policy. I use game theory and mechanism design to analyze related questions. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
I am grateful to Aalto University, Emil Aaltonen Foundation, Finnish Cultural Foundation, Fulbright Finland Foundation, HSE Support Foundation, KAUTE Foundation, and OP Group Research Foundation for funding my research work.  </p>

Microeconomic theory is fun, but I also like to wander through the streets of Helsinki on a sunlit summer night, marveling at the Art Nouveau façades and watching the waves of the Baltic Sea, perhaps accompanied by the majesty of Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2.  </p> 


## Working Papers

**"Pigouvian Income Taxation"**, with Lassi Ahlvik and Matti Liski, 2024. [Link.](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2024/working-paper/pigouvian-income-taxation)

This paper develops a mechanism design approach to study externalities and redistribution. The mechanism screens individuals' social weights to strike a balance among broad distributional objectives, incentives to work, and incentives to reduce externalities. The welfare-optimal allocation can be decentralized through income taxation, defining income-dependent externality payments. Two applications use individual-level administrative data on incomes, pollution measures, and financial burdens to demonstrate how population characteristics shape the optimal policy on carbon emissions.


**"Fake It Till You Exit"**, with Eero Mäenpää, 2024. [Link.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4kgpftk6id0hlql5tenjl/ANpn5MvEZHDa5Gu-UpMLoeo?rlkey=dfhphq6ezpvp4bylvtwqpv5ss&st=tjgkwm41&dl=0)

We examine how the possibility of buyouts affects start-ups’ incentives to innovate, enter markets and compete when there is asymmetric information about start-ups’ prospects. Informational frictions may encourage a start-up to adopt a ”fake-it-till-you-exit strategy” where it innovates little, enters the market without actual competitive advantage and captures the market by selling at a low price to signal it is valuable. Banning acquisitions may stimulate start-ups’ innovation but decrease pre-buyout-stage competition.


**"Cat in a Bag"**, with Jana Gieselmann and Teemu Pekkarinen, 2024. 

We consider a market in which sellers privately choose vertical product qualities, consumers then receive information about the chosen qualities according to a predetermined information structure, and the sellers compete in prices given consumers' posterior beliefs. We characterize market outcomes for different information structures and levels of competition. With a monopoly seller, the seller-optimal information structure fully discloses quality and incentivizes welfare-maximizing quality provision. If there are several sellers, the seller-optimal symmetric information structure is coarse and incentivizes randomization in quality choice, leading to vertical differentiation in terms of consumers' posterior beliefs. Notably, if the information structure is designed to maximize sellers’ profit, competition among sellers leads to lower quality and buyers having less information about quality. We compare the results to an alternative model in which quality is exogenous, eliminating the moral hazard problem.
