## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly in applied microeconomic theory. I employ the tools of game theory and information economics to analyze a wide range of current important policy topics, ranging from fair implementation of climate targets to the regulation of start-up acquisitions.

In academic year 2023--24, I am visiting the Department of Economics at MIT as a Fulbright grantee.
