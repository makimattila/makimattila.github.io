## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly in applied microeconomic theory. I employ the tools of game theory and information economics to examine a diverse range of current policy issues, ranging from equitable environmental policy to the regulation of start-up acquisitions.

In academic year 2023--24, I am visiting the Department of Economics at MIT as a Fulbright grantee.
