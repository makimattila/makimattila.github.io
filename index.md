## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly in applied microeconomic theory. I employ the tools of game theory and mechanism design to analyze economic behavior and policy. 

In the academic year 2023--24, I am visiting the Department of Economics at MIT as a Fulbright grantee.
