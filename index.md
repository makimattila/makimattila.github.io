## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at Aalto University. My research interests are mainly in applied microeconomic theory. I employ the tools of game theory and information economics to analyze a wide range of current important policy topics, ranging from the fair implementation of climate targets to the regulation of startup acquisitions.

In the academic year 2023-24, I am visiting the Department of Economics at MIT as a Fulbright grantee.
