## About Me

<p align="justify"> 
I am a PhD student in economics at Aalto University. I started my PhD studies in 2021, spent academic year 2023&ndash;24 at MIT Department of Economics, and plan to complete the PhD program in 2026. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
My field of research is microeconomics. I employ game theory and mechanism design to examine how incomplete information influences market behavior and optimal government policy. Most of my research is theoretical, but the applications include pressing 21st-century issues, ranging from environmental crises and the rise of inequality to the regulation of the technology industry. When appropriate, I supplement the theoretical insights with empirical evidence. </p>

<p align="justify"> 
I am grateful to Aalto University, Emil Aaltonen Foundation, Finnish Cultural Foundation, Fulbright Finland Foundation, HSE Support Foundation, KAUTE Foundation, and OP Group Research Foundation for funding my research work.  </p> 

<p align="justify"> 
Microeconomics is fun, but I also like to wander through the streets of Helsinki on a sunlit summer night&mdash;marveling at the Art Nouveau façades, watching the waves of the Baltic Sea and listening to a Sibelius symphony.  </p>
