**"Pigouvian Income Taxation,"** with Lassi Ahlvik and Matti Liski, 2024. [Link.](https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2024/working-paper/pigouvian-income-taxation)

Major climate policies deviate from uniform carbon taxation by varying implicit externality prices across income groups. We show that such deviations are optimal in a mechanism design model of externalities and redistribution: price paid on the externality can be either progressive or regressive in income. The optimal allocation is decentralized through income taxation, with income-dependent externality payments determined by aversion to inequality in cost burdens and behavioral responses of emissions and earnings. Using Finnish administrative data, we quantify these determinants and find that optimal policies are progressive for vehicles but regressive for electricity consumption.

**"Fake It Till You Exit,"** with Eero Mäenpää, 2024. [Link.](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/4kgpftk6id0hlql5tenjl/ANpn5MvEZHDa5Gu-UpMLoeo?rlkey=dfhphq6ezpvp4bylvtwqpv5ss&st=tjgkwm41&dl=0)

We examine how the possibility of buyouts affects start-ups’ incentives to innovate, enter markets and compete when there is asymmetric information about start-ups’ prospects. Informational frictions may encourage a start-up to adopt a ”fake-it-till-you-exit strategy” where it innovates little, enters the market without actual competitive advantage and captures the market by selling at a low price to signal it is valuable. Banning acquisitions may stimulate start-ups’ innovation but decrease pre-buyout-stage competition.

**"The Design and Price of Certification,"** with Yucheng Shang and Ryo Shirakawa, 2024. [Link.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5062549)

We study optimal certification design in a setting where an information sender, with partial information about an unknown state, seeks to persuade an information receiver to take a desired action. The sender can purchase a test from a profit-maximizing certifier who offers a menu of tests to screen the sender's belief. The selling mechanism gives information to the receiver through two channels: actual informativeness of tests and the sender's choice among the options in the menu. We show that the revenue-maximizing menu of tests consists of a single test, and the receiver obtains zero surplus. Instead, if the certifier can conceal which option the sender selects, the optimal menu may include multiple tests. 

**"Cat in a Bag,"** with Jana Gieselmann and Teemu Pekkarinen, 2024. 

We consider a market in which sellers privately choose vertical product qualities, consumers then receive information about the chosen qualities according to a predetermined information structure, and the sellers compete in prices given consumers' posterior beliefs. We characterize market outcomes for different information structures and levels of competition. With a monopoly seller, the seller-optimal information structure fully discloses quality and incentivizes welfare-maximizing quality provision. If there are several sellers, the seller-optimal symmetric information structure is coarse and incentivizes randomization in quality choice, leading to vertical differentiation in terms of consumers' posterior beliefs. Notably, if the information structure is designed to maximize sellers’ profit, competition among sellers leads to lower quality and buyers having less information about quality. We compare the results to an alternative model in which quality is exogenous, eliminating the moral hazard problem.
